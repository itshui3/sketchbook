<!-- A component found on freecodecamp.org -->

Component contains: 
-buttons related to testing code
-laymen's test failed indications

I can describe this as being two divs, each evenly spaced on a y axis. 


The first div contains button cards with text-centering on both x, y
color, and border
These buttons have a hover effect that inverses the color of the background as well as text but leaves the border black
Click seems to draw an outline within the border due to focus[I think]


The second div contains three cards rendering test information in laymen's terms. These cards are placed right on top of each other and alternate coloration. [stretch: nth selector implementation]
